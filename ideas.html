                    <h3>Career Choices</h3>
                    <p>
                        The problem of people choosing the wrong careers is a stress.The individual puts the business at
                        risk of not being successful because of them not actively playing their part in the
                        organization.Reason why I would recommend this is so that people avoid wasting time, unwanted
                        jobs, and unemployment. VR does a good thing and influences better choices, because it gives you
                        a preview of what to expect realistically.This mechanism can be seen the coach we have always needed.
                    <p>
                    <div>
                        <p>The VR is going to be the tool used where individuals can create an environment of their future
                            career they might have interest in. They can literally experience and live in that environment
                            to see whether they enjoy this career path or if they still want to be a part of it.
                        <p>

                    </div>
                    <p>e.g. Roller coaster ride, one can use the VR headsets and it will feel as thou you actually on
                        that roller coaster ride.You feel like  you are on the actual ride.
                    <div>e.g. A forensic scientist, you get to see if you love doing these investigations and see if you can
                        handle the tasks that you need to handle. You get to see if you are really interested in all
                        that task dealing with investigation or whether it all bores you. VR tool allows them to
                        visualise and check out before the approach. Forensic scientist use this information in ways that benefit
                        investigation, like revisit crime scenes, gain 3D documentation of the scenery ,the data gained
                        is an advantage and it helps them solve cases . VR  can be reproduced and allows you to see through the eyes of a witness
                        by means of recordings, these recordings support their investigation which makes VR very useful.</div>

                        <h3>Medical Field</h3>
                        <p>People have fear  of surgery and the unknowns,it can be serious leading them to avoid getting
                            treated or have their medical operations and surgery because of their fears, but their fears
                            could be serious. According to Sara Lindberg (15 may, 2020)."But some people, that fear can
                            become excessive and lead to avoidance of certain medical procedures, such as surgery,it is
                            called tomophobia”
                        <p>
                        <div>
                            </p>South Africa can make VR more available in the medical field, so many people will find
                            it handy.Both doctors and patients are able to benefit from this mechanism.Doctors are able
                            to preview what the surgery will turn out to be and they can get a glimpse before doing the
                            actual surgery.The implementation has the ability to even let the doctor step in the patients
                            shoes, they get to plan as well. The VR tool shows how the surgery looks like before doing it .Some
                            analyzing is done by VR giving the ability to see the scenario and take note of what should
                            and should not be done <div>

                            </div>
                            <p>e.g. Doctors have to work or do surgery around the spinal area they can wear the VR gear
                                and actually try out the surgery , like if it is fixing a bone structure the surgeon could
                                first see their ability and readiness for the surgery by doing it in the virtual world
                                by means of the headset or other tools, they get to do the work making it seem as thou
                                it is reality occurring this predicts how successful the surgery could be.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>VR allows test runs without using and wasting the real products and machinery</li>
                                <li> It Saves so much money</li>
                                <li>Used as an interaction tool, they can get some feedback </li>
                                <li>Will solve the issue that many face fear of the unexpected </li>
                                <li>This predicts how successful the surgery could be</li>
                                <li>Patients will not avoid surgery because they will be able to see it in a
                                    perspective before the actual surgery</li>
                                <li>Way of accurate preparation</li>
                                <li>No longer have to avoid facing our fears, we get to face them and that will motivate
                                    us that it can be done and it’s not all harmful and so stressful.</li>
