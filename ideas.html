                    <h3>Career Choices</h3>
                    <p>
                        The problem of people choosing the wrong careers is a stress.The individual puts the business at
                        risk of not being successfull because of them not actively playing their part in the
                        organization.
                    <p>
                    <div>
                        <p>The VR is going to be the tool used where individuals can create an environment of the future
                            career they might have interest in. They can literally experience and live that environment
                            to see whether they enjoy this career path or if they still want to be a part of it.
                        <p>

                    </div>
                    <p>e.g. Roller coaster ride, one can use the VR headsets and it will feel as thou you actually on
                        that roller coaster ride.
                    <div>e.g. a forensic scientist, you get see if you love doing these investigation and see if you can
                        handle the tasks that you need to handle. You get to see if you are really interested in all
                        that task dealing with investigation or whether it all bores you. VR tool allows them to visualise and
                        check out before the approach. Forensic scientist use this information in ways that benefit
                        investigation, like revisit crime scenes, gain 3D documentation of the scenery ,the data gained is an advantage
                        and it helps them solve cases ,VR be reproduced and allow to see through the eyes of a witness by
                        recordings, these recordings support their investigation which makes VR very useful.</div>

                        <li>the coach we have always needed</li>
                        <li>test your own suitability for the job</li>
                        <li>avoid the uncertainty and making bad career choices</li>
                        <li>Nobody wants to make wrong decision, especially regarding your future.

                        <h3>Medical Field</h3>
                        <p>People have fear of surgery and the unknowns, can be serious leading them to avoid getting
                            treated or have their medical operations and surgery because of their fears, but their fears
                            could be serious. According to Sara Lindberg (15 may, 2020).”But some people, that fear can
                            become excessive and lead to avoidance of certain medical procedures, such as surgery,
                            called tomophobia”
                        <p>
                        <div>
                            </p>South Africa can make VR more available in the medical field, so many people will find
                            it handy.Both doctors and patients are able to benefit from this mechanism.Doctors are able to
                            preview what the surgery will turn out to be and they can get a glimpse before doing the
                            actual surgery.<div>

                            </div>
                            <p>e.g. doctor has to work or do surgery around the spinal area they can wear the VR gear
                                and actual try out the surgery like if it is fixing a bone structure the surgeon could
                                first see their ability and readiness for the surgery by doing it in the virtual world
                                by means of the headset or other tools, they get to do the work making it seem as thou
                                it is reality occurring this predicts how successful the surgery could be.
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> Do test runs without using and wasting the real products and machinery</li>
                                <li>Save so much money</li>
                                <li>Used as an interaction tool, they can get some feedback </li>
                                <li>Will solve the issue that many face fear of the unexpected </li>
                                <li>This predicts how successful the surgery could be</li>
                                <li>Patients will not avoid surgery because they will be able to see it in a
                                perspective before the actual surgery</li>
                                <li>Way of accurate preparation</li>
                                <li>No longer have to avoid facing our fears, we get to face them and that will motivate
                                    us that it can be done and it’s not all harmful and so stressful.</li>
