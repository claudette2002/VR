                        The VR is going to be the tool used where individuals can create an environment of the future
                        career they might have interest in. They can literally experience and live that environment to
                        see whether they enjoy this career path or if they still want to be a part of it.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>e.g. Roller coaster ride, one can use the VR headsets and it will feel as thou you actually on that
                    roller coaster ride
                <div>e.g. a forensic scientist, you get see if you love doing these investigation and see if you can
                    handle
                    the tasks that you need to handle. You get to see if you are really interested in all that task
                    dealing with investigation or whether it all bores you. VR tool allows them to visualise and check
                    out before the approach. Forensic scientist use this information in ways that benefit investigation,
                    like revisit crime scenes, gain 3D documentation of the scenery ,the data gained is an advantage and
                    it helps them solve cases ,VR be reproduced and allow to see through the eyes of a witness by
                    recordings, these recordings support their investigation which makes VR very useful.</div>
