                    <h2>Motivations behind the project</h2>
                    <p> Lets face it before doing any reasearch I had no idea what VR was ,but going through my research
                        it is quite interesting. The world around us is moving at such a vast pace and I was like "WOW",
                        why not educate others too? My motivation comes from my own lack of knoweledge and i wanted to
                        eduate the people of SA, because they deserve to have some sort of understanding of what the future
                        could turn out to be.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>So lets learn more about this new innovation called virtual really.Dont be one that is
                            lost and confused but be filled with knoweledge and understanding about the world around
                            you.Lets get educated about the future and try our utmost best to utilise our knowledge to
                            our benefits.</p>

                        <div>
                            <p></p>We should keep up with the latest technology because without us even knowing it is
                            indeed taking over and we should use all the knowledge we can get to equipt our selfs so that we
                            are ready for it all.I have developed this site to educate people with basic knowledge and to show them the new perspectives and
                            ideas.Do not forget to note the benefits this could bring us.So lets get educated together.
