                    <h2>Motivations behind the project</h2>
                    <p> Reality is, before doing any reasearch I had no idea what VR was ,but going through my research I found that 
                        it is quite interesting. The world around us is moving at such a vast pace and I was so astounded by it
                        Why not educate others too? My motivation came from my  lack of knoweledge regarding VR and this motivated me  to
                        eduate the people of South Africa, because they deserve to have some sort of understanding of what the future
                        could turn out to be.</p>

                    <div>
                        <p>So lets learn more about this new innovation called virtual really. Do not be one that is
                            uneducated ragarding your future,but be filled with knoweledge and understanding about the world around
                            you.Lets get educated about the future and try our utmost best to utilise our knowledge to
                            our benefits.</p>

                        <div>
                            <p></p>We should keep up with the latest technology because without education or knowledege regarding it we will not understand why the things happening around us are happening.
                             We should use all the knowledge available to us so we can get to equipped and prepared for what the future holds for us with regards to technology
                            .I have developed this site to educate people with basic knowledge and to show them the new perspectives and
                            ideas.Do not forget to note the benefits this could bring us.So lets get educated together.
