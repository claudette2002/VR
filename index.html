                    <h2>What is VR?</h2>
                    <p>Virtual reality is not something very familiar to us, it is a new and innovative form technology.
                        Virtual reality is so much more advanced. You get the chance to enter the virtual world and
                        do things that can involve your senses like touching, grabbing etc. (Zheng, Chan& Gibson, 1998,
                        Guttentag, 2010).</p>
                    <p>
                        The popularity is increasing amongst people in the world. We are not all certain, clear and
                        fully educated as of what virtual reality is. If you want to explore new experiences with
                        technology, virtual reality will be perfect. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It gives the sense that you actually living the moment, it physically real and allows you to
                        live scene. It is a great way for people to create their own world but experiencing it in the 3D
                        world. Virtual reality is far from an illusion yet it is brain activity, it gives the feeling,
                        we are free to interact through the tool provided such as a VR headset.
                    </p>
                    <div class="article-set">
                        <p>There are many uses and advantages of virtual reality and I believe it may be able to resolve
                            some problem faced in our country. Coolest thing is that you can live out and face fears,
                            the little world you get placed into, feels real and you are literally living in that world
                            for as long as you use the necessary tools.</p>
