                    <h2>What is VR?</h2>
                    <p>It is a way in which people can interact with things other than the real world ,they do so by
                        using different tools.Virtual reality is not something very familiar to us, it is a new and
                        innovative form technology. Virtual reality is so much more advanced. You get the chance to
                        enter the virtual world and do things that involves your senses like touching, grabbing etc. (Zheng, Chan& Gibson, 1998,
                        Guttentag, 2010).</p>
                    <p>
                        The popularity is increasing amongst people in the world. We are not all certain, clear and
                        fully educated as of what virtual reality is. If you want to explore new experiences with
                        technology, virtual reality will be perfect.

                        It gives the sense that you are actually living the moment, it feels physically real and allows you
                        to live in that scene. It is a great way for people to create their own world but experiencing it
                        in the 3D world. Virtual reality is far from an illusion yet it is brain activity, it gives the feeling of reality,
                        we are free to interact through the tool provided such as a VR headset.
                    </p>
                    <div class="article-set">
                        <p>There are many uses and advantages of virtual reality and I believe it may be able to resolve
                            some problems faced in our country. Coolest thing is that you can live out and face fears.
                            The little world you get placed into  feels real and you are literally living in that world
                            for as long as you use the necessary tools.</p>

                    <p>The world around us is advancing and we are heading into the fourth industrial revolution that
                        means technology will become so much more important and needed in our daily lives. VR is just
                        one way in which we will experience technology, this mechanism is so useful and it brings or
                        gives you the ability to see yourself in a specific environment, which advances your
                        experience and can be a very fun journey.</p>
