                    <h3>What interests me?</h3>
                    <p>Having fun and investing in people are my favourite things to do.
                        I love doing adventerous activities and sporty things with my friends and family.
                        Especially hiking, because when hiking you get to see the beauty of the things from a different
                        perspective.
                        People dancing ,singing ,rapping or just using their talents is so amazing to me ,it excites me
                        and makes me happy when I see what others are capable of.Interesting things intrigue
                        me, new things are fun for me and I am open to them most of the time.Values are close to me and
                        I do not ever plan on letting it go.Experiencing and learning new things remain forever an interest to me.

                    <h3>My studies</h3>
                    <p>I matriculated from Harold Cressy high school, which is such an amazing school.The teachers
                        pushed me to do well and they always saw so much potential in me and that was my motiation to
                        always
                        make them proud.Matricualting during the pandemic taught me lessons that helped me face my
                        challenges head on.Math was my favourite subject at school,the others were a bit more on the
                        boring side yet I still worked hard in all my subjects.

                    <p> The year 2021 is when I got accepted and started studying at the university of Western Cape.I
                        chose to study a bcom general because ever since high school I have loved and enjoyed this
                        stream .I would have to say that this was one of the best decisions I have ever made in my life
                        because I am enjoying what I am studying.
                        It is not an easy course and it definately has it's challenges, however this pushes me and
                        encourages me to work to the best of my ability.
                        With these challenges I learn more and more about my own capabilities, strengths and weaknesses.

                        <p>I would love to use my career to create an impact in the business world.
                            This career field has so many possibilitities and it is quite broad.It will allows
                            me to explore options and then choose the best career.My skillls and knowledge should 
                             become a well used asset and I want to hae a great name wen t come to my work ethics</p>
