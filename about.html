                        People dancing ,singing ,rapping or just using their talents is so amazing to me ,it excites me
                        and makes me happy when I see what others are capable of.Infact interesting things interest

                    <h3>My studies</h3>
                    <p>I have matriculated from the high school Harold Cressy ,which is such an amazing school,they have
                        pushed me to do well and always saw so much potential in me and that was my motiation to always
                        make them proud.Matricualting during the pandemic gave me lessons that take me through my
                        challenges.Math was my favourite subject at school,the others were a bit more on the boring side yet I
                        still worked hard at all my subjects.

                    <p> The year 2021 is when I got accepted and started studying at the university of Western Cape.I
                        have chosen to study a bcom general because ever since high school I have loved and enjoyed this
                        stream .I would have to say this choice in my live was a good one because I am enjoying ,when I
                        say enjoying I do not mean it is easy ,it is definately challenging and with that reason it
                        pushes me. With the challenges I am taught more and more of my own capabilities.
